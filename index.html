        <h1>Crowther Codes</h1>
        <p>I am new to the world of web page design and functionality but have spent much of my recent time honing in on my skills to deliver a functional web page with style and purpose - for more details visit the about page.
          During my time in A level Computing, I developed an online booking system for a local restaurant named Croma in Prestwich as part of my final assessment.  Since then I have been fascinated by the wealth of possibilities 
          available to those who are willing to spend time looking behind the glass of their computer screens.  Below are some games I have created for my own amusement and enjoyment
          while learning Javascript and the p5 Library; please feel free to try them out.

          <h3>Asteroid Shooter</h3>
          <p>Navigate your ship through the asteroid field with the arrow keys (space ships can't reverse), use the space bar to break the 
            asteroids up and ensure your survival... or will it?</p>

          <h3>Flappy Bird</h3>
          <p>Press the space bar to gain height and navigate your  way between the pipes blocking your way; watch out, the further you make it the harder it gets.  Just 
            a fun one where I've started to add some design features to the original game.

          <h3>Bubble Bursting</h3>
          <p>This is just quite a soothing visual interactivity.  Click the teal part of the screen to create bubbles and watch them bounce, delete them by clicking on them.
            I found it to be somehat challenging to remove all the bubbles from the scree once there are quite a few, try it yourself.
