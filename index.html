      <p>Hi and welcome to my web page. I have just completed the Northcoders Boot Camp and am looking to hone my skills
        to deliver functional web/software applications with style and purpose for many areas of business - for more
        details
        visit my about page.
        During my time in A level Computing, I developed an online booking system for a local restaurant named Croma in
        Prestwich as part of my final assessment. Since then I have been fascinated by the wealth of possibilities
        available to those who are willing to spend time looking behind the glass of their computer screens. Below are
        some games I have created for my own amusement and enjoyment
        while learning Javascript and the p5 Library; please feel free to try them out.

        <h3>Asteroid Shooter</h3>
        <p>Navigate your ship through the asteroid field with the arrow keys (space ships can't reverse), use the space
          bar to break the
          asteroids up and ensure your survival... or will it?</p>

        <a href="./Flappy-Bird/index.html" target="_blank"><img class="pics" src="./images/flappybird.png"></a>
        <h3>Flappy Bird</h3>
        <p>Press the space bar to gain height and navigate your way between the pipes blocking your way; watch out, the
          further you make it the harder it gets. Just
          a fun one where I've started to add some design features to the original game.

        <h3>Bubble Bursting</h3>
        <p>This is just quite a soothing visual interactivity. Click the teal part of the screen to create bubbles and
          watch them bounce, delete them by clicking on them.
          I found it to be somewhat challenging to remove all the bubbles from the screen once there are quite a few,
          try
          it yourself.
