        <h1 class="page-title">Coding Experience</h1>
        <p>I am a Fullstack developer who has recently graduated the Northcoders Bootcamp, completing projects
          collaboratively and individually. Northcoders is based in Manchester following an industry led curriculum
          primarily using Javascript. All code was produced using TDD, a variety of pair-programming, individual
          work and in the final phase a group project where 5 of us collaborated to produce an end-to-end application.
          Practices of agile methodology, along with daily standups and a kanban board were essential to maintain good
          communication throughout.
        </p>
        <p>As part of the course I created a Fullstack news application for phone or laptop use built with Reddit’s
          style in mind. It utilises a RESTful API and was built with Node.js, Express.js, PSQL and Knex.js.
          The FrontEnd was created using React.js and CSS for styling, testing was mainly made up of Mocha,
          Chai and Supertest.</p>
        <p>For our final project five other Northcoders and myself worked in our final 2 weeks to produce FOMO: an
          interactive event finder
          package where the user can sign up with a personality test and check for last minute event ideas in their
          area.
          Businesses are able to post events and view user data to help plan future events. Tech Stack: Python (No
          previous
          experience), Flask, React Native, React, JavaScript, PSQL, Pytest. </p>
        <h1 class="page-title">Teaching Experience</h1>
        <p>I have gained experience in teaching Computer sciences and have been doing so for KS3 over the past two
          years, which has led me to be very competent with many key program software on both Macs and PCs along with
          programming languages in javascript and HTML. I have run the chess club and organised tournaments against
          other schools and at large events hosted by the Doha Bank Qatar School. I have organised the participation of
          GEMS Wellington in a Pi Day Maths competition as well and I have accompanied students on a camps international
          activity trip, working to maintain safety and high behavioural expectations throughout.</p>
        <p>I have personally selected the schemes of work and written the rotas for the Maths department I work in for
          the past 3 years, I have placed orders for what books the school will be using progressing in to GCSE and for
          KS3. I have set up intervention classes during morning form time for students below their target grade and
          personally selected and directed what material was used to support this intervention. I have aided teachers
          who have struggled with the behaviour of particular children and offered guidance to those less confident in
          teaching than myself.</p>
        <p>In June of 2018 I was promoted to Assessment and Data Manager, my duties included: recording and maintaining
          of the progress and attainment data across the secondary school; individual target setting from CAT4 (UK’s
          most widely used entrance test) results; guiding and mentoring teachers in entering and analysing their data.
          I have overseen report processing to parents and used data to set targets for students and implement
          interventions for students below target based on their results in key areas. I have used data to forecast the
          progress and attainment for the whole school by the end of the academic year and give teachers targeted
          intervention lists for their individual subjects. I feel this to be a particularly useful asset and
          transferable skill in the role of taxes and accounting as I am no stranger to interpreting and using data to
          benefit the company I work for.</p>
        <p>Over a 3-year time period during breaks in College and University study and I spent a large amount of time
          working for Steve Chestney contract Window Cleaning company showing commitment, hard work and resilience. Mr.
          Chestney has said he has rarely seen his employees so reliable to show up to work come wind, rain or shine
          over his long career and admires my level of commitment.</p>

          <h3>Professional Skills Development</h3>
          <p>I like to keep my coding skills on top form and develop new skills through use of multiple web sites
            including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy - Crowy92</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.codewars.com/dashboard">Code Wars - Crowy92</a> - Rank 6kyu</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp - Crowy92</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub - Crowy92</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>I also like to follow several youtubers when it comes to learning new code I find there are some amazing
            resources on youtube. My favourite channel is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman">"The Coding
              Train"</a> which I find to be a fun and entertaining way to learn new skills and consolidate what I
            already know. I recommend subscribing to anyone wishing to do the same.</p>
          <p>In my spare time I like to keep my fitness up through Running, Cycling, Football and Rock Climbing.</p>
